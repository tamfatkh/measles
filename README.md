# Measles
This is part of the working Python code and the publicly available data used in the measles paper titled "The 2025 Measles Outbreak in Texas" by Dr. Tamer Oraby and Dr. Martial Ndeffo-Mbah.

Put all of the files in the same folder. Use the Python Jupyter notebook to run the code. Make sure to use the correct path to the folder at the beginning of the code.
